# Resources Updater - Substance Painter plugin

This plugin adds a __Resources Update__ button to the main toolbar of Substance Painter. This button opens a new window which allows to list the resources used in a project. The list shows in red resources considered as outdated (different from the version present in the shelf). The __update__ button present in the interface allows to replace a resource by another one from the shelf.

## Installation

Download or clone this project into the Substance Painter plugins folder. The plugins folder can be opened from Substance Painter through the menu ``Plugins/Plugins folder``. Substance Painter needs to be restarted for the plugin to take effect.
